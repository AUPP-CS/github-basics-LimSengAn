Hi, my name is Lim Seng An

I am a senior student here at AUPP, and this is my first semester for this year.
I am trying to learn front-end and back-end web development as I wish to be able to understand how to create, operate and maintain websites in the future. 
I wish you all a great semester and look forward to learning with you.
Cheers!

Kindest regards
